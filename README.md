# Golf-Club-AWS-Deployment-Pipeline
##Overview
This project showcases a fully **automated CI/CD pipeline** for a static Golf Club website, built using **Jenkins, Docker**, and hosted on **AWS EC2**.

The frontend was developed using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I took charge of the entire DevOps lifecycle: from automating quality and security checks to building and deploying Docker containers. The pipeline was built from scratch, integrating tools like **SonarQube, Retire.js, Docker Hub, and GitHub webhooks**.
